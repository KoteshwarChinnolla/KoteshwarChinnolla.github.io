                        <p>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence, where a machine learns without
                            explicitly programmed, machine learning concerns the development and study of statistical
                            algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus
                            perform tasks without explicit instructions.</p>
                        <p>Machine learning is a set of algorithms. It involves using algorithms to identify hidden
                            patterns in datasets, enabling predictions on new data. </p>

                        <p>For a human the learning basically is reading, understating and answering. These are the
                            three simple steps we as a human follow. Similarly, to make a machine learn, we make the
                            machine to follow the same three simple steps. In machine terms those are collecting data,
                            processing data and making predictions out of it.</p>
                        <p>To make a machine learn from our data, the data needs to be in a machine-understandable way
                            so our first step is data preprocessing, after making the data into machine
                            machine-understandable format we need to treat the data to the machine. For perfect
                            training, we required a perfect model so our next step is to select a perfect model. Now
                            machine is giving the desired results then we have to deploy our model in a real-time
                            environment this is where deployment comes into the picture.</p>

                        <p>As raw data it is noisy, biased, incomplete, unstructured, and missing . so processing raw
                            data may throe errors, such that it is most important to pre process the data. poor data can
                            lead to incorrect prediction, lower accuracy etc.. maintaining the data quality is most
                            impotent to train any model.</p>

                            +1 and -1 of standard deviation). so the points far from mean are considered as outliers and

                        <h2>Data Augmentation</h2>
                        <p>Data augmentation is the process of artificially generating new data from existing data,
                            primarily to train new machine learning (ML) models. ML models require large and varied
                            datasets for initial training</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Data augmentation uses pre-existing data to create new data samples that can improve
                                model optimization and generalizability.</p>

                        <h3>Why Data Augmentation</h3>
                        <p>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models relay on large data sets develop accurate models in
                            various contexts. Data Augmentation helps filling out missing values and increase the data
                            size by including variety of data. this helps in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>improving model accuracy</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Reduced data dependency (not being depending on larger data for training)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>improving model robustness (Including data in such a way that it include all
                                    situations, such as noise and most unexpected situations to make model trained model
                                    strong)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Mitigate overfitting in training data</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Data augmentation can be applied when the training data is too small, when there is
                            overfitting in the datasets or if there is lot of missing variables in the datasets. the
                            augumentation can be applies in different areas such as <strong>image Augmentation,Text data
                                Augmentation and Audio Data augmentation </strong></p>

                        <al>Text Augmentation</al>
                        <p>Text augmentation is the process of artificially generating new text from existing text,
                            primarily to train machine learning (ML) models or NLP models. The fields like computer
                            vision and natural language processing require large and varied datasets for initial
                            training. Making the dataset more robust and generalizable improves the performance of the
                            model. There are various text augmentation techniques that can be applied to improve the
                            performance of the model. Majorly text augmentation input replacing , adding, removing,
                            shuffling, etc. lets see some of the text augmentation techniques.</p>

                            the nouns with their respective synonyms. the synonyms are generated using WordNet(a popular

                            their corresponding labels. we are creating new virtual dataset from the training data set
                            by mixing up the features and their corresponding labels. the implementation is basically
                            creating a NN model making it generate a new input and a new output labels.</p>

                        <p>Audio recognition systems such as Google assistant, Alexa, Amazon Echo etc.. are developed on Audio data and detecting more complex audios is a challenge. as people are more interested into voice assistants it is more important to detect the audio form most complex environments such as noisy, low audio, multiple audios etc.. The systems only achieve this complex tasks by making it to train through such data sets. But collecting such datasets needs lot of human effort. Hence this is where data augmentation comes to rescue. By using this techniques we can build more robust and large datasets to make detection more accurate.</p>
