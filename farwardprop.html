                        <br><pa>Although a neural network is a black box which is very hard to decode what kind of patterns it is making to produce the high accuracy outputs. a neural network actually been inspired by the biological neural networks. where the flow of information is so complex to understand and explain. the accuracy of a neural network depends on the dimensions. more the dimensions more will be the accuracy. the dimensions are nothing but the number of hidden layers and number of nodes in each hidden layer. more the hidden layers better the system classifies the output. the lays in between the input and output layers are called hidden layers.  </pa><br>
                        <br><pa> So a neural network is basically the connections of nodes. where this nodes are grouped as layers. this layers are classified as input layers, hidden layers and output layers. the nodes in a input layer represents input features and the nodes in output layer represent the predicted output. But the nodes in the hidden layers has some suppurate functionality where it is responsible for the mathematical operations such as Matrix multiplication and activation functions. Each node in the hidden layer is capable of generating outputs by this operations. the nodes in one layer are connected to the nodes in the other layer. this connections are assigned with certain values this are known as the weights. this weights involve in the Matrix multiplication. Each node is assigned with a bias value. Bias is added to the Matrix multiplication to get the output. this output is then passed through the activation function to produce the final output of that particular node. so output of previous layer acts as the input to the next layer. The output of the last layer is the final output. </pa><br>

                        <br><pa>Understanding higher dimensions of Neural Networks is very difficult. let us consider 4 layers. one Input , 2 Hidden and 1 output. Input with two features(nodes) and output with one feature(nodes). lets consider this as the base NN for further analysis.</pa><br>

                        <br><p><SS>Why we use weights? </SS> Weights are something that can be interrupted to get our desired output. you can also consider it as the set of values that can be multiplied to the input such that we can get our output. so we always try to change the weights until we get the perfect output. the final weights are used as the multiplicand to the new input to get the prediction result. As you can see in the frame one each node output can be calculated by multiplying that outputs to the weights. </p><br>

                        <br><pa><SS>Why Activation function ?</SS> as we seen that the outputs are calculated by weights and biases. these output are passed through the activation function to get the non linearity. it is a mathematical operation that is applied to the outputs of the nodes that results in effective learning. to understand it better let say we have are solving a classification problem in this case the out of the node will be a numerical value but as a classification problem we need to convert it to a class labels. so we apply the activation function such that output will be increased or decreased to get the class labels.</pa>
                        <br><br><SS> Activation functions are classified based on whether it is applied on output or hidden layers and whether the problem statement is classification and regression</SS>
